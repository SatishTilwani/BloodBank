# Blood Bank System
 Bootstrap, PHP & MySQL based Web Application.

## Problem Statement:
According to statistics, every two seconds someone requires blood
donation. Family or replacement donors and paid donors still remain a
significant source of blood for transfusion in many countries but still there
is a shortage of blood worldwide for deserving patients and there are only
few platforms where blood can be donated and can be directly given to the
clients.

## Introduction:
Our Blood bank system solves a problem of people who need blood at urgent
bases as in our country there is a shortage of blood banks. If some organizations
sell blood so most of the people cannot contact them easily as there is no proper
mechanism for blood bank especially in government hospitals. People who are
injured in road accidents need blood at urgent bases. Some of the people who do
not have relatives in town and hospital do not have proper blood banks then or
BMS comes into play and plays a vital role in saving the lives of many people. Our
platform is directed to solve the problem for thalassemia patients who need
blood almost every week, so they also pre-book their donor at our site
